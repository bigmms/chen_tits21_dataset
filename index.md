## Abstract
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

## Details
We contribute **xxxxx** database, a large-scale sun glare image dataset, which has several appealing properties:

- **xxxx** consists of 100k synthesized glare images, glare-free images, occlusion images, and foreground images.

- To simulate the catoptric behaviors of sunlight to synthesize glare images, each base masks could be classified into six subset:

| Subset          | Hexagonal | Octagonal | Star-shaped | Triangular | Rectangular | Ring-shaped |
|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:------------|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
| #base masks     |       12  | 15  |12|13|16|7|
| #training image |    12000  | 15000|12000|13000|16000|7000|
| #testing image  |     1922  | 2490|1992|2158|2656|1162|
